# Armada Golang Dev Evaluation
Evaluation for golang developer test

## Instructions
* Create a miniature database which will handle records as documents.
* A simple key-value CRUD operations will suffice.
* Must persist data to storage but sophisticated formats are not needed. A simple CSV or even plain text file will be more than enough.
* Since this rather large task has time constraint, it is not required for this to be production ready or optimized. But rather the goal here is to know you better as a developer while I can walk see your thought process and design decisions in real time.
* Please do not hesitate to ask questions or discuss design considerations.

## Dos and Donts
* This is an open book test and feel free to Google or lookup any language or library references.
* You are allowed to use any libraries except ready made embedded databases (which makes this exercise pointless)
* ChatGPT and other GenAI tools cannot be used.
